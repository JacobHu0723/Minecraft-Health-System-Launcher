From Sunday to Thursday, it will be limited to 20 minutes per day.

From Friday to Saturday, it will be limited to 90 minutes per day.

Humanized design: You can time out for 30 minutes every day to prevent quitting during the battle (but it is not recommended to time out). 

Forcibly log out after 30 minutes of timeout, and cannot enter this day.

You can modify the path in the data.json to your launcher path to start normally.
